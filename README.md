## Description: 
Has multiple rows and columns with different products. Also has different prices for different products with unlimited number of products per slot. As a real vending machine has two holes, the one from left for picking the product, and the one from right from picking the rest. To pick a product, use the keypad on the top right side, each keypad has a maximum of three products variations: F(Fruits), S(Soda)
and P(Chips). The online vending machine should have a keypad to enter the product code and a way to add credit(money) to the machine. Accepts coins of 5o, 20 & 10 cents. 
If the amount inserted is the machine is more than the price of the product, the machine will return the remained rest.

Technologies used: For achieving the above I used JQuery,CSS,HTML;
